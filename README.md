# Churn Risk Analysis
In this case study I have used customer data to calculate churn rate, segmented the accounts, and run an analysis to identify accounts that are at risk of churn. 

The purpose is to identify high churn risk accounts, to be targeted in a proactive retention plan which should help reduce voluntary churn.
